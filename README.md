## Code Structure

This reporting tool needs to complete three tasks:

- What are the most popular three articles of all time?
  - `count_most_read_article()`
  - `print_most_read_article()`
- Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
  - `count_most_read_author()`
  - `print_most_read_author()`
- On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?
  - `count_errors()`
  - `print_count_errors()`

For each task, there are two functions composed. One for query operation and another for printing the results.
Finally there is the mean function that runs all of the six function and print out all the results.

## Run the code

There is one source code file. To run the code, simple type `python3 projectLog.py` in your terminal.
